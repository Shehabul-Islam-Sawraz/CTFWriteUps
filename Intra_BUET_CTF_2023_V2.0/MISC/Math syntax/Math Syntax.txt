One day you travel to an ancient village. There, you step into a school and find something weird in the 
chalkboard:

nadokalol * mekalal = nadokalkalol
pekalol + mekalal = sakalal
namekalal + fanamekalol = mekalal
dokalkalol - namekalal = fanavodokalkalal
namekalal * dokalol = fanamekalol * pekalol
lokalal * mekalal = lokalkalal
pekalol + pekalol + mekalal - lokalal = rekalol
sakalkalal * pekalol = gokalkalkalol
dokalol = sakalal + mekalal
pekalol + pekalol - sakalal - mekalal = rekalol
lokalal - pekalol = sakalal
nadokalol * nalokalal = nafanavolokalkalkalol
namekalal + namekalal = fanamekalol
fanamekalol * mekalal = pekalol
zokalal + pekalol = sakalkalal
It appears that someone was counting in this system. They erased most of their writing. However, the following numbers were not erased, and are found in the following order with no lines in between them:

lokalal
nagokalol
fanagokalal
gokalol
nazokalal
fanazokalol
zokalal
