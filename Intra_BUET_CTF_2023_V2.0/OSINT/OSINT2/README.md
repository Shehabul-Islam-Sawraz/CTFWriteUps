### Solution of OSINT2

---

#### Process

---

+ I just googled `federal agency whose focal point is exploitation of open source material` and found [this](https://irp.fas.org/dni/osc/index.html), where I saw the agency name to be **`DNI Open Source Center`**
+ Then I again googled `which year DNI was founded` and found it to be **`April 22, 2005
`** 

So, adjusting the text to the flag format, we got our final flag which is:

>```
> buetsec{DNI_Open_Source_Center:2005}
