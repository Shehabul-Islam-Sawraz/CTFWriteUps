+ I just scanned the given [Ship](./Photos/Ship.jpg) image using google lens and found [this link](https://www.balticshipping.com/vessel/imo/9314545)
+ From the link, we got that the Ship name is `MUSTAFA YAGCI`, it has Engine power of `2880 KW`, Year of build is `2006` and Builder is `MEDYILMAZ SHIPYARD - KARADENIZ EREGLI, TURKEY`.

So, adjusting the text to the flag format, we got our final flag which is:
